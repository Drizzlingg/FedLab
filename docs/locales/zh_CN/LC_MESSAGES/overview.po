"Federated learning (FL), proposed by Google at the very beginning, is "
"recently a burgeoning research area of machine learning, which aims to "
"protect individual data privacy in distributed machine learning process, "
"especially in finance, smart healthcare and edge computing. Different "
"from traditional data-centered distributed machine learning, participants"
" in FL setting utilize localized data to train local model, then "
"leverages specific strategies with other participants to acquire the "
"final model collaboratively, avoiding direct data sharing behavior."

"To relieve the burden of researchers in implementing FL algorithms and "
"emancipate FL scientists from repetitive implementation of basic FL "
"setting, we introduce highly customizable framework **FedLab** in this "
"work. **FedLab** provides the necessary modules for FL simulation, "
"including communication, compression, model optimization, data partition "
"and other functional modules. **FedLab** users can build FL simulation "
"environment with custom modules like playing with LEGO bricks. For better"
" understanding and easy usage, FL algorithm benchmark implemented in "
"**FedLab** are also presented."
