"Federated learning (FL), proposed by Google at the very beginning, is "
"recently a burgeoning research area of machine learning, which aims to "
"protect individual data privacy in distributed machine learning process, "
"especially in finance, smart healthcare and edge computing. Different "
"from traditional data-centered distributed machine learning, participants"
" in FL setting utilize localized data to train local model, then "
"leverages specific strategies with other participants to acquire the "
"final model collaboratively, avoiding direct data sharing behavior."

"To relieve the burden of researchers in implementing FL algorithms and "
"emancipate FL scientists from repetitive implementation of basic FL "
"setting, we introduce highly customizable framework **FedLab** in this "
"work. **FedLab** provides the necessary modules for FL simulation, "
"including communication, compression, model optimization, data partition "
"and other functional modules. **FedLab** users can build FL simulation "
"environment with custom modules like playing with LEGO bricks. For better"
" understanding and easy usage, FL algorithm benchmark implemented in "
"**FedLab** are also presented."

"**FedLab** provides two basic roles in FL setting: ``Server`` and "
"``Client``. Each ``Server``/``Client`` consists of two components called "
"``NetworkManager`` and ``ParameterHandler``/``Trainer``."

"``NetworkManager`` module manages message process task, which provides "
"interfaces to customize communication agreements and compression"

"``ParameterHandler`` is responsible for backend computation in "

"The connection between ``NetworkManager`` and ``ParameterServerHandler`` "
"in ``Server`` is shown as below. ``NetworkManager`` processes message and"
" calls ``ParameterServerHandler.on_receive()`` method, while "
"``ParameterServerHandler`` performs training as well as computation "
"process of server (model aggregation for example), and updates the global"
" model."

"**FedLab** supports simulation executed on multiple machines with correct"

"**Hierarchical** mode for **FedLab** is designed for situations where "
"both **standalone** and **cross-machine** are insufficient for "
"simulation. **FedLab** promotes ``Scheduler`` as middle-server to "

"between server and a client group containing a subset of clients. And "
"server can communicate with clients in different LAN via corresponding "
"``Scheduler``."
