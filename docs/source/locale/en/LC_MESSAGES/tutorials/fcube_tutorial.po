"FCUBE :cite:p:`li2021federated` is a synthetic dataset for research in "
"non-IID scenario with feature imbalance. This dataset is proposed in "

"Data points of FCUBE conain 3 features, that is, "
":math:`\\mathcal{D}_{\\text{FCUBE}} = \\{ (\\mathbf{x}, y) \\}`, where "
"each data point :math:`\\mathbf{x} = (x_1, x_2, x_3)`, and label :math:`y"
" \\in \\{ 0, 1 \\}`. The distribution of data points is a cube in three "
"dimentions, and if :math:`x_1 > 0`, then :math:`y = 0`, while :math:`y=1`"
" when :math:`x_1 < 0`. By default, we suggest 4000 data points for "
"trainset, and 1000 for testset."
